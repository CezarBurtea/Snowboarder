Link where to find the game ------> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17zhgewcJUUhUVaVQs3OsgHe1yMQ2aYu9?usp=share_link

Here you can find the Snowboarder game. The reason why I created a shared drive, it is because the game has over 25MB, the 
capacity of an upload on Github. You have to download the folder and extract it in you PC. 
The game is availabe only for Windows.
